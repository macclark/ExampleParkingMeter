# ExampleParkingMeter

This is an example of my work used for demonstration purposes. Inside the comments section of the header you will find how the application is supposed to work. This project example was limited to one day and works in C#. Working versions of these examples are available upon request

///The meter has two possible customer inputs - a maximum amount of money to debit from a card, or an option to charge for the maximum time available on that meter.

///The program should calculate the minutes purchased, debit the card the correct amount, and print a ticket containing the parking end time, actual amount charged, and number of minutes purchased.
 
///Fees are charged at $1.75 per hour
 
///Different meters have different time limits (1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 5 hours,and 30 minutes)
 
///Meters are only valid from 7am to 7pm Monday to Saturday, and 1pm to 7pmSundays.
 
///Only charge up to the permitted time limit and during the valid daily hours for a meter
 
///Do not overcharge, for example, a $10 amount on a 1 hour limit meter should only charge for 1 hour
